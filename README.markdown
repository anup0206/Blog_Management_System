# Blog Management System

## Overview
This is a Blog Management System built using **ReactJS**, **TailwindCSS**, **Formik**, **Yup**, **Axios**, and **React-Toastify**. The system allows users to create, edit, view, and manage blog posts efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for handling blog-related operations with form validation and real-time notifications.

## Features
- **Create Blog**: Add new blog posts with a form that supports title, content, and other relevant fields.
- **Edit Blog**: Update existing blog posts with seamless form handling.
- **View Blog**: Display individual blog posts or a list of all blogs.
- **Manage Blogs**: Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on blog posts.
- **Form Validation**: Validate input fields using Formik and Yup for robust error handling.
- **Notifications**: Display success/error messages using React-Toastify.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with TailwindCSS for a modern and responsive UI.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Formik**: Form management library for handling form state and submissions.
- **Yup**: Schema builder for form validation.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **React-Toastify**: Notification library for displaying toast messages.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different views (e.g., create, edit, view blogs).
